## üí° Implementation Details

### Text Processing Pipeline
```python
def process_text(text):
    # Preprocessing
    chunks = chunk_text(text)
    
    # Summarization
    summaries = [summarize(chunk) for chunk in chunks]
    
    # Analysis
    stats = analyze_text(text)
    
    return combine_results(summaries, stats)
```

### Key Components
- Custom text chunking algorithm
- BART-large-CNN model integration
- Sentiment analysis system
- Topic extraction module

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Note

This project is currently configured for local development due to the computational costs associated with hosting large language models. The architecture is designed for scalability and can be deployed when resources permit.
